        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>At genesis, 99 Czarcoins were minted.  We proceeded on block one to forge an additional 224999901 Units of which 111000111 were burned to bootstrap Czarparty, leaving an initial spendable supply of 113,999,889 CZR.  Up to and including block 35,000, miners are assigned a reward of 10 CZR for their contributions of hashing power.  Afterwards, the network shifts compensation to originate from the initial supply pool, signaling the beginning of fair distribution to the public.</p>

        <h2>Transactional Volume</h2>
        <p>The potential for exchange on the Czarcoin Network exceeds that of any decentralized network in existence.  As a result, applications built on this particular chain are reaching the Production Target of 50,000 Daily Transactions.  To minimize production of new units during the distribution phase, the block reward is being limited to 0.001 units per round.  The Daily Yield Goal is 5,000 CZR from Transaction Fees alone.</p>

        <h2>Inflation</h2>
        <p>To account for growth and lost units, the block reward will be adjusted on a least a quarterly basis to acheive the rate of 1% inflation after the distribution of the initial supply.  The measure of inflation is a target and not a mandate as market conditions will overall dictate an accurate rate at which it shall be set.</p>

        <h2>Freemarket Distribution</h2>
        <p>In addition to Mining Production, distribution is also set to occur through traditional offerings.  To maintain core unit value during distribution, the Original Stakeholders have agreed to not unneccessarily dilute their share.  </p>
