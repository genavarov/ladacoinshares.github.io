    <h2>It took seven days to forge the original Czarcoin Genesis Block</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="lead">Twin Merkle Verification was used to prove the existence of the specification.  Scrypt Proof of Work was selected as the proven path to massively scalable network security.</p>

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>We designed the platform with miners as an integral component to the network.  With the largest cryptocurrency reserve in human existence bootstraped on top of the blockchain, the potential for transactional volume exceeds figures never before obtained on any decentralized network.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Industry Class tools are openly available to secure wallets in an environment where private keys never have to be exposed visually.  Users can be confident that their accounts are solely theirs without exception.  This fundamental outweighs any benefit of deriviative systems.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Stability</h2>
        <p>A low inflation rate of 1% that is adjustable with market conditions provides the mechanism to cover for growth.  The algorithm for the proof of work scheme is environmentally friendly and allows for fair competition in unit production.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Speed</h2>
        <p>128 second confirmation targets combined with a difficulty adjustment every 100 blocks adds a responsive feel to Czarcoin.  The spending of unconfirmed units enables peers with realtime transactional capalities.</p>
